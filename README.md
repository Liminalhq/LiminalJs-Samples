# LiminalJs-Samples

SDK will help you to interact with multiple digital assets over a single robust interface. Several sensitive operations, such as signing transactions and status, must to be performed on the client-side.

We provide and recommend the use of our Software Development Kit (SDK), which implements these client-side wallet features and interfaces with our APIs.

## Node Version Support Policy
Currently, our SDK is available in JavaScript & Typescript and runs using Node.js. Please make sure you are running at least a greater version of Node 14 (LTS release is recommended) and the npm version must be greater than 6.

## Documentation
API and SDK documentation can be found at [https://docs.lmnl.app/docs](https://docs.lmnl.app/docs).
